# Blockdude

This is a quick and dirty JavaScript remake of the classic [BlockDude by Brandon Sterner](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/authors/3/322.html), originally for TI-83 the calculator.

The graphics are lame. That's not really my thing.

You may need to disable ad and privacy blockers to load the game. These tools break the game by blocking `keypress.js`. You can review the script served to the game [here](http://cbarrick.github.io/blockdude/keypress/keypress.js) and check out the Keypress project home page [here](http://dmauro.github.io/Keypress/).

Keypress is by David Mauro and released under the Apache license. A copy of that license is included in the Keypress submodule included in this repo. All other code is released to the public domain.
